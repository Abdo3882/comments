               <p class="div1-body-p2" >“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. Theywere very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. Theagile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took mylearning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could everhave. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as anexample of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land ajob as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
